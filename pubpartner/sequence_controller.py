"""
Turn sequencing and pacing for standalone PubPartner runtimes.

PubPartner's cartridge/memory/prompt layers are timing-agnostic by design —
they answer "what should this character say" but never "when should this
character speak." When PubPartner runs bundled inside PubCast, PubCast's
switchblade_governor answers that "when" question: it reads emotional state
(VDI) and scene composition and emits a priority vector that tells engines
(including, indirectly, PubPartner) how to allocate turns and cycles.

PubPartner Portable has no PubCast, no VDI, no scene state. It still needs
an answer to "when." This module is that answer: a small, self-contained
turn pacer that decides when a cartridge is ready for its next turn, how
long to wait before treating a burst of rapid messages as one turn, and how
to score newly-captured memories on its own, without any external
scheduler.

Design contract:
  - This module knows nothing about cartridges, LLMs, or prompts. It only
    tracks timing and emits decisions. cartridge.py and prompt_assembler.py
    must never import this module — the dependency runs one direction only,
    from portable_runtime.py down into sequence_controller.py and cartridge.py
    separately. This keeps the cartridge layer honestly portable: it can be
    embedded in PubCast, in Portable, or in something that hasn't been built
    yet, without ever knowing which pacer (if any) is driving it.
  - External priority signals are optional, not required. If a caller
    (e.g. a future PubCast bridge) supplies a PriorityHint, SequenceController
    uses it to adjust debounce/importance behavior. If nothing is supplied,
    it falls back to its own defaults. Nothing in this module blocks on an
    external signal ever arriving.
